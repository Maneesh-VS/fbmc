This project deals with the performance analysis of Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) transceivers and comparing it with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transceivers.The primary intention of this project was to deploy and compare both the FBMC and OFDM systems based on three significant performance parameters: Power Spectral Density (PSD), Bit Error Rate (BER) against Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR).The results confirm that FBMC yields enhanced spectral efficiency and strongly decreased out-of-band emissions. On BER vs SNR, FBMC proves to be competitive, particularly for high SNR environments. Moreover, FBMC features less PAPR compared to OFDM.
